# DEV-CON-2
The GDD for our second Development Contract (Mohawk College, GAME-10016-02) as well as the files/code/etc.

## DEV-CON 2: THE GDD ZONE

#### Vision: 
In this prototype, you play as someone attempting to escape a hedge maze... but *egad!* A piece of shrubbery has come to life and decided to make *you* it's target! Escape the maze before time runs out, lest the snaking shrubbery turns you into fertilizer!

#### Goals:

**Question:**
In what ways can a "stalking" mechanic in a maze puzzle be engaging?

**Why**:
Mazes are one of those "foundational" puzzles and as such, iterating on them has the potential to create interesting results - as well, we feel that our concept can be further expanded on many ways!

#### Mechanics:

**Priority:** 
"Dungeon crawler" type movment in a maze, with a stalker-type enemy that follows your character's movements. Timer to encourage speediness and/or up the difficulty. 

**Bonus:**
Power-up (Hedgetrimmers/Pesticide) that removes some of the stalking shrub. 

**Instructions:** Directional keys to move around the maze.

#### Rough Notes:
*(This is for our rough notes taken during meetings/class/etc. as it relates to the contract. As such, optimal formatting is not a priority here - copy and paste as you like!)*

- Dungeon Crawler Top Down Type
- Maze, top down? 
- Snake mechanics kinda
- Creature tracks your steps, you canâ€™t backtrack through the maze 
- power ups that send the creature back a few steps?
- A timer to make it immediate?
- Deadly shrub, power-ups are hedge clippers/pesticide 
- Power up consumes time?
- Question can be similar
